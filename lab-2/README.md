#Summary
This lab addresses the first readers-writers problem. The objective of this lab is to fill in the code so that the program will
be able to create multiple reader and writer threads. The writers will first write account information to a new file and the reader
threads will read that account information. Mutex locks are used to lock sections of code so that both types of threads do not read
and write to it at once.
